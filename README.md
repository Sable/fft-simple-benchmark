FFT (Fast Fourier Transform)
============================

Performs the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) function on a random data set. The input data was modified from random numbers to a sum of two periodic signals to test that the extraction indeed recovers the signals.

Note: This application was taken from the SHOC suite
      (http://ft.ornl.gov/doku/shoc/).
